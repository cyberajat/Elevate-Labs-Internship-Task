# 🔐 Task 6 – Password Strength and Best Practices

## 🎯 Objective
Test password strength and understand best practices for secure passwords.

## ✅ Tested Passwords

| Password         | Score | Crack Time         | Feedback                     |
|------------------|-------|--------------------|-------------------------------|
| pass123          | 10%   | Less than 1 second | Too short, all lowercase      |
| Password123      | 45%   | Few minutes        | Add symbols                   |
| P@ssw0rd123!     | 80%   | Several years      | Strong, but common pattern    |
| Xj#9uA7$Lp2^Ws   | 100%  | Centuries          | Excellent password            |

## 🧠 Tips for Creating Strong Passwords
- Use 12–16 characters minimum
- Mix letters, numbers, and special symbols
- Avoid common patterns or dictionary words
- Never reuse passwords across accounts
- Use a password manager to store securely

## 🛡 Common Attack Techniques
- **Brute Force**: Tries every possible password
- **Dictionary Attack**: Uses known wordlists (e.g., `rockyou.txt`)
- **Credential Stuffing**: Uses leaked passwords from data breaches

## 🧪 Conclusion
Strong, unique passwords significantly reduce the risk of compromise. Length and complexity exponentially increase cracking time.
