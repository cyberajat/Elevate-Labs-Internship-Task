## 🔐 How VPN Enhances Privacy

- **IP Masking**: Hides your real IP and location from websites and trackers.
- **Encryption**: VeePN encrypts browser traffic, protecting data from sniffing on public Wi-Fi.
- **Bypasses Geo-restrictions**: Lets you access content blocked in your region.

## ⚠️ Limitations of Browser-Based VPNs

- Only encrypts **Chrome browser traffic** (not system-wide).
- May be slower than direct connection depending on server load.
- Doesn’t prevent phishing or malware if user interacts with malicious content.

## 🧠 Summary

Using the **VeePN Chrome extension**, I experienced secure browsing and verified IP masking. Although browser-based VPNs don’t encrypt all traffic, they offer a fast and easy privacy boost for casual users, especially on public Wi-Fi or shared networks.
